# Transportation Image Object Detection Web Application
Welcome to our Transportation Image Object Detection Web Application! This application allows users to upload transportation-related images, such as traffic camera images, and perform object detection on those images using the Volo V8 model. We've built this application with Streamlit as the backend, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with.
